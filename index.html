		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Ever since I was a child, I had always wanted to go into a career that involved making things,
		so for the longest time I said that I wanted to be an engineer, without really knowing what that meant.
		It wasn't until I reached highschool that I decided that I wanted to combine that desire with my love of video games,
		which lead to me pursuing a career in video game programming.</p>
		
		
		
		<p>I am interested by almost every aspect of video game design, from the game theory to the actual programming fundamentals.
		I find myself most facinated with the intricacies of creating a good UI , and so I tend to consider myself to be 
		a bit of a UI snob.</p>
