		<h1>Pizza Palace</h1>
		<p>Pizza Palace was a fictitious restaurant app for Android devices that I created as part of a group project. I was in charge of 
		creating the Main Page, Order Page, and Delivery Timer Pages, while my partner created the Pizza List Page, Tip Calculator, and Contacts Page.
		The biggest part of the project was the order page, which the user used to create their pizza by selecting the size and toppings they would like for their 
		pizza. The price of the pizza would be calculated in real time as the user selected and deselected different options. The Delivery Timer was basically just a 
		Timer Intent, which opened the mobile device's default timer app and set it to count down for 30 minutes. The main page was just a view pager that let you swipe
		through a few images, and a small About Us blurb telling you about the restaurant.</p>
