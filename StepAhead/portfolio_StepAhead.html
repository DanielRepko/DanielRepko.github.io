		<h1>Step Ahead</h1>
		<p>Step Ahead was another Android application that I created as part of a group project. It is an exercise assistance app 
		that is able to track information about your run, such as time, distance, and even calories burned based on your input height and weight.
		The app was also able to present you with a graph showing your progress gaining and losing weight based on your weight entries. I was in charge 
		of creating the Run Tracker and the Run Journals (which held additional user input info about the run, such as how they felt the weather, the terrain run on), 
		while my partner was in charge of creating the Weight Journals (not really "Journals" rather than records of weight inputs), the Weight Progress graph, the contact and social media page
		(the app was able to display the most recent tweets from a fake twitter acount we made for the app), and the settings page. I managed to figure out how to not only make the app track 
		your location and distance in real time, but I even made it so that it could track this while the app was in the background. The one thing that my partner and I both agreed 
		we would have liked to change is the appearence of the app, as due to time constraints we were unable to spend very much time making the app look nice.
